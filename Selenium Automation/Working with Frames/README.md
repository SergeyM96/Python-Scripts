# Selenium Frames Test

This Python test suite is designed to verify the functionality of interacting with frames using Chrome WebDriver.

## Description

The script automates the following steps:

1. Sets up the Chrome WebDriver for testing.
2. Navigates to web pages containing frames.
3. Switches to specific frames and verifies the content within them.
4. Interacts with elements inside frames and validates the changes.
5. Cleans up after the test by quitting the browser instance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver for Python
- Chrome browser

## Usage

1. Install Python if not already installed.
2. Install Selenium WebDriver for Python using pip: `pip install selenium`
3. Ensure that the Chrome browser is installed on your system.
4. Run the script using Python: `python frames_test.py`

## Notes

- This script assumes that the web pages containing frames are accessible and have specific frame names or IDs. You may need to modify the URLs and frame identifiers to match your specific test environment.
- Adjust the wait times in the test methods as needed to observe the browser's actions and changes within frames.
